**Enfocado** is more than a theme, it is a concept of **"how themes should be"**, focusing on what is really important to developers: the **code** and nothing else.

The features of this theme are:

- Use of **well-founded CIELAB** Selenized black color scheme. Learn about its features and design [here](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized/blob/master/features-and-design.md).
- Choose from two **styles** of **Enfocado** theme:
  - **Nature**, for developers who are always connected with nature.
  - **Neon**, for more daring, outgoing and futuristic coders.
- Only three colors are used mainly to highlight the syntax, this following the **color guidelines for web design**, which indicate that a nice interface should have **only three colors**, no more.
- The important colors (orange & red) are reserved for **important alerts only**, as they should be.
- Focus on **coding** and nothing more than **coding**.
- What is not important, is dimmed, **really minimalist**.
- Human writing (italicized) is simulated for syntax groups (comments, methods, titles, and more...) that are usually written with **human language**.
